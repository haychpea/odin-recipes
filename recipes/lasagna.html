    <h2>How to make the Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch 
            oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed 
            tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with 
            sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, 
            covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
            lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
            noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
            ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 
            teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom 
            of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise 
            over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese 
            mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 
            1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 
            cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent 
            sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure 
            the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil 
            and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 
            minutes before serving.
