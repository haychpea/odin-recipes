    <h2>How to make the Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook 
            the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely 
            browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a 
            plate and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger 
            to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until 
            onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry 
            powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon 
            of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for 
            about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 
            tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the 
            mixture; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices 
            on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, 
            turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam 
            masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no 
            longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 
            20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
            center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
            Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
