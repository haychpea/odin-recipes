TOP Recipes Project
===================

This is the recipes project that is assigned at the end of the HTML foundations section of the Foundations curriculum.

Recipes consist of

 - Lasagna
 - Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari)
 - Chocolate Fudge

 Reflecting on this project, it has allowed me to see how the basic structure of a website is created, enabling further interest in how extra HTML code I am yet to learn will plug into it to enable further features.

 This is the first of many websites I will create and I aim to be able to make my own portfolio in the coming months with the basics that I have practiced in this project.
